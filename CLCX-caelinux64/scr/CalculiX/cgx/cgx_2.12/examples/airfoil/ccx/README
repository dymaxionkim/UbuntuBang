Purpose:
This is a CalculiX-cfd example. The same model as for isaac 
will be read. But because ccx is still much slower as isaac the mesh-density 
in the boundary-layer is set to four w/o any mesh-bias. In addition the model 
is sweeped from 2D to 3D. It is an inviscid calculation. In the current state 
of ccx the achievable accuracy is only satisfying for inviscid calculations 
with an overall high mesh density. 

The results can be compared to AGARD Report AR 138, May 1979

call cgx in the build mode:

  cgx -b send.fbl

call ccx with the prepared input file: (use 4 threads, for quad-core cpu)

  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ccx rae2822

Post-processing with:

  cgx rae2822.frd


Remark:
a restart is possible after writing velocity, temperature and pressure with:
send all abq lc<nr-of-dataset> (3 times, one for each dataset)
Then include the files in the initial conditions section and
start ccx again


PS
a second geometry file prepared for meshing with pentaeders is provided. The 
calculation speed is faster but accuray is lower:
call cgx in the build mode:

  cgx -b send_penta.fbl
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ccx rae2822_penta
  cgx rae2822_penta.frd
