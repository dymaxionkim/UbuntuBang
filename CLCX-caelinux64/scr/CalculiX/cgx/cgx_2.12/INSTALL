                          Basic Installation
                          ==================

    If you encounter problems please read the last section "Possible
    problems and some hints" and the section "Known Problems" in the
    documentation.

    There are two possible ways of instalation:
    - Section A: Installation of the 64bit-binary (was compiled on suse 11)
    - Section B: Instalation from the source:
                 recomended if you encounter problems with the binary 
                 or if your hardware is not supported.

    For full functionallity you need the following additional programs:
    - convert (ImageMagick)
    - pstops (from psutils)
    - firefox or any other html-browser (modify cgx.h if not firefox )
    - gv (ghostview) (modify cgx.h if not gv )
    - ng_vol from the netgen project. Replace this file with the one located
      in the folder cgx_2.10/netgen and build it in the netgen directory.
      This allows tet-meshing with a target-element-size.


 A: Installation of the binary
    --------------------------

 1. Get the binary and do the following
    - bunzip2 cgx_2.10.bz2 (beware your browser could scip the ending
      .bz2, then please rename the filename to the above one before unzipping )

    It is necessary to have openGL on your system!

    The libraries  
    /usr/lib64/libGL.so
    /usr/lib64/libGLU.so   (The libGLU should be the one from SGI. Otherwise the
                          nurbs rendering is not supported)

    You might create links to other locations if the libraries are 
    stored at other places.

    For example:

    ln -s /usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib/libGL.so.3 /usr/lib/libGL.so

 2. login as root

 3. if possible rename the binary to /usr/local/bin/cgx
    mv cgx_2.10 /usr/local/bin/cgx
    chmod ao+rx /usr/local/bin/cgx

 4. If you like the help-system to work then please do the following:

 5. login as root if not already done.

 4. get the documentation (html) and do the following:
    - move the file containing the docu cgx_2.10.htm.tar.bz2 to /usr/local 
    - bunzip2 cgx_2.10.htm.tar.bz2 (beware sometimes the ending .bz2 is missed, 
      please rename the filename to the above one)
    - tar -xvf cgx_2.10.htm.tar
    - the html-browser must be known as "firefox"
      so if you dont have firefox you should create an link like:
      ln -s <your browser location> /usr/local/bin/firefox

 7. Check the path /usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/doc/cgx
    all the html files should be located there

 8. Check the installation, if you performed step 3. type:
    cgx -b dummy.fbd
    a window should appear on your screen.
    Go with the mouse-ponter outside the inner big black rectangle.
    Press the left mouse button. The menu will appear. Go down to "Help" and
    choose "Html Manual cgx". 
    The browser should open and the documentation should be vissible. If not be
    sure that the documentation is in /usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/doc/cgx

 9. get the examples and do the following
    - move the file cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2 to /usr/local 
    - bunzip2 cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2
    - tar -xvf cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2



 B: Instalation from the source:
    ----------------------------

    The `configure' shell script is not yet ready. Therefore some manual 
    fixes to the Makefile might be necessary.

    Make sure that you have the devel packages for the graphic system
    installed (the headers for X11 etc.)

    You need openGL on your system. Check your file system for the
    two following libraries:

    The openGL-library:              libGL.so  or  libMesaGL.so
    The higher level openGL-library: libGLU.so  or  libMesaGLU.so

    The libGLU should be the one from SGI. Otherwise the nurbs rendering
    is not supported.

    On some systems the extension might also be ~.a instead of ~.so

    You might search for this files with for example "locate libGL" or 
    "find /usr/* -name libGL* -print"

    If you find only libMesaGL and libMesaGLU instead of libGL and libGLU
    you have to create a link or a copy with the names libGL and libGLU
    but ceep the extension .a or .so.

    This files should be located in:
    /usr/lib64/

    otherwhise you have to modify the file:
    /usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/src/Makefile

    If you do not have this libs or if you
    have any trouble later on, then first check the CD from your distribution.

    The original glut package from mark Kilgard is now in the distribution and
    will be compiled with the other source files.

 1. Unpack the file cgx_2.10.all.tar.bz2 in "/usr/local".

 2. Then change to the following directory with:
    cd /usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/src

 3. Change the path names in the Makefile to the ones used on your system if
    necessary.

 4. If your installation path is not "/usr/local" then you must also change
    the path for the html-help-files in "cgx.h",
    see parameter "HELPFILE". If your web-browser is not firefox change the 
    parameter "BROWSER" also.

 5. run "make" as root. On 32bit PCs you have to modify the Makefile. 
    Change lib64 to lib below LFLAGS .
    If you have trouble with c++ code use Makefile_pure_c to use only c code.
    But you will not be able to deal with nurbs any more.

    Then copy the binary "cgx" to
    "/usr/local/bin/cgx" with:
    cp cgx /usr/local/bin/cgx

    If /usr/local/bin does not exist, create it with:
    mkdir /usr/local/bin

    Then you might change the protections:
    chmod ao+rx /usr/local/bin/cgx

 6. If you have "latex" and "latex2html" on your system then run "latex cgx" 
    in "/usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/doc" (run it 3 times!!!) and then run
    "latex2html cgx". 
    This creates the html-help-files. Alternatively you might download them
    as well. Then get cgx_2.10.htm.tar.bz2 and unpack this package in 
    /usr/local/.

 7. The program needs to write an info file to your home directory during run 
    time. Be sure that "HOME" is defined and that you have write permission to
    this directory. Type "echo $HOME" and check your permissions for the 
    printed directory.

 8. Check the installation, type:
    cgx -b dummy.fbd
    and a window should appear on your screen.
    Go with the mouse-ponter outside the inner black rectangle.
    Press the left mouse button. The menu will appear. Go down to "Help" and
    choose "Html Manual (cgx)". 
    The browser should open and the documentation should be vissible. If not be
    sure that the documentation is in /usr/local/CalculiX/cgx_2.10/doc/cgx

 9. get the examples and do the following
    - move the file cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2 to /usr/local 
    - bunzip2 cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2
    - tar -xvf cgx_2.10.exa.tar.bz2



    Possible problems and some hints:
    ---------------------------------

 
    If you get some linker errors then you probably have multiple libGL,
    libglut or libGLU on your system.

    If commands like "plot n all" are not recognized by the program
    then your mouse pointer was probably not in the main window during 
    typing {;->)
 
    If the loader complains that a specific lib is not there, then often a 
    newer version is available. Create a link with the required name to the 
    new lib (ln -s new-lib-name old-lib-name).

    If tet-meshing fails with the following messages:
     ERROR: The input file "test.vol" could not be opened.
     ERROR: No mesh-file found
    then ng_vol from the netgen project is not available.






 
Good luck,

Klaus Wittig
